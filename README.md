# MEAN Stack Task Manager

## Overview

The MEAN Stack Task Manager is a robust web application developed to streamline task management for users. Leveraging the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js), the system incorporates essential features such as secure user authentication, dynamic list creation, and intuitive task management.

## Key Features

### 1. User Authentication

The system implements a secure user authentication mechanism using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users can sign up with unique credentials and log in securely to access their personalized task management environment.

### 2. List Management

Users can create, edit, and delete lists, facilitating efficient organization of tasks. The application allows for dynamic list creation, enabling users to adapt their task organization to specific needs.

### 3. Task Management

Within each list, users can create tasks with detailed descriptions and deadlines. Tasks are fully editable, providing flexibility for users to make modifications as needed.

### 4. Task Completion

Tasks can be marked as completed with a simple click, visually signifying their status with a strikethrough.

### 5. User-Friendly Interface

The frontend, built with Angular, delivers an intuitive and responsive user interface. Users can navigate through lists, tasks, and other functionalities with minimal effort.

### 6. Database Integration

MongoDB serves as the backend database, storing user information, lists, and tasks. This NoSQL database ensures scalability and flexibility to accommodate the growing needs of the application.

### 7. Styling with SCSS

The application's visual appeal is enhanced through the use of SCSS (Sassy CSS), allowing for the creation of modular and maintainable stylesheets, contributing to a sleek and modern user interface.

### 8. Task and List Editing

Users have the ability to edit both tasks and lists, ensuring a flexible and adaptable task management environment.

### 9. Data Deletion

The system provides users with the capability to delete both entire lists and individual tasks, offering a streamlined approach to decluttering and organizing their task space.

### 10. User-Centric Experience

Each user enjoys a personalized dashboard where they can view all their lists and associated tasks, ensuring that the application caters to their unique organizational needs.

## Conclusion

The MEAN Stack Task Manager is a feature-rich and user-friendly application designed to simplify the task management process. By leveraging the power of MEAN technologies, the project combines secure authentication, dynamic list and task management, and an aesthetically pleasing frontend to provide users with an efficient and enjoyable task management experience.
